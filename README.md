JavaFX TableView demo with Observablelist of Student objects containing 8 attributes

In learning JavaFX, I wanted to highlight different elements such as bindings, Observable lists, SimpleStringProperties, TableView, 
SetOnAction, lambda notation and different types of nodes like VBox, HBox, BorderPane, TextField, Button, and Label. Also contains 
the method dialogBox which accepts a String message and opens a dialog box with an "ok" button any time you need to notify a user 
of issues on certain events.
